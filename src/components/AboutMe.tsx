          When I’m not shipping code or shouting “You’ll Never Walk Alone” at my
          screen, you’ll probably find me deep in a philosophical rabbit hole,
          trying to figure out why humans exist. I’m a stoic in character and an
          artist at heart, I love things that feel intentional, meaningful, and
          beautifully imperfect. That’s why the Japanese concept of wabi-sabi is
          one of my favourite ideas, the charm of things that aren’t perfect.
          Honestly, that’s how I approach both life and code. I’m also a huge
          fan of the How to Take Over the World podcast, because who doesn’t
          want to learn leadership lessons from the most interesting people in
          history? If you like football, philosophy, conspiracies, creativity,
          or just chaotic curiosity in general, we’ll get along perfectly.
